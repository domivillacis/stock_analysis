# Green Stocks Analysis
## Overview of Project
For this data project, I've been approached by Steve, whom recently got his degree in finance and is helping his parents invest in the stock market. His parents are interested in investing solely in green energy stocks, but Steve thinks his parents should diversify their investment.

In this analysis we are going to review the trade performance of the different stocks in 2017 and 2018, and with the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a programming language that will allow us to code through excel, we will obtain the pertinent data to help Steve's family to invest not only successfully but wisely.

## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
