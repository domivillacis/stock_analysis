# Green Stocks Analysis
## Overview of Project
For this data project, I've been approached by Steve, whom recently got his degree in finance and is helping his parents invest in the stock market. His parents are interested in investing solely in green energy stocks, but Steve thinks his parents should diversify their investment.

In this project we are going to review the trading performance of different stocks in 2018 and 2018, and analyse whether it is profitable to invest or not. By using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language, we will be able to effitiently code the exact data we need to make this comparison and we will obtain relevant data to help Steve's family invest successfully.


## Results: 

For 2018, I started analysing specifically the shares traded by the DQ stock. To obtain this data, 3 values that helped us with the calculation were created: “Year”, “Total Daily Volume” (the total number of shares traded throughout the year) and “Return” (the percentage difference in price from the beginning to the end of the year).

As a result, the findings of the first analysis is that DQ shares in 2018 fell by 63%, and that means, right now is not the best time to invest in this green stock. However, 2 other stocks performed better in that.

On the other hand, I have also analyzed the performance of all the stocks in 2018. As we can see, the data of our results are not favorable, only two stocks that are ENPH and RUN had positive traded shares.
